# AI-Impact-on-Job-Market

Created a Future Job Market Dashboard (2024â€“2030) to show key trends in job openings, automation risk, gender diversity, remote work, and salaries. The dashboard highlights job demand by industry and location and compares AI impact and automation risks across jobs. This helps understand where opportunities are growing and how technology is shaping future careers.
